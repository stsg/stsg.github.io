      <description>Dev Could Rust be the future of JavaScript infrastructure? &amp;ndash; The Future of JavaScript Tooling.
Some mistakes Rust doesn’t catch &amp;ndash; When you look at all the combinations of all possible instructions in a programming language, only a tiny fraction are useful programs.

      <description>Dev Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes ago? &amp;ndash; A study found that Java developers backtracked every 6 minutes, meaning they reverted their code to a previous state (e.g., by clicking undo or pressing Ctrl-Z). These undo actions come in bursts and are often followed by successive redo actions. In fact, one participant in a different study used undo/redo 40 times in 5 minutes! When asked why they did this, they revealed they were trying to view some intermediate state of the code in the middle of a change.</description>
