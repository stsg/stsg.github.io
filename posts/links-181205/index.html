27/Rust-survey-2018.html) &ndash; The Rust survey team has shared the results of
its 2018 survey on the state of the language. (The survey received 5,991
responses, three-quarters of which were from current Rust users.) Among the
findings: nearly a quarter of users have used Rust for at least two years,
and nearly a quarter of users also use Rust daily. However, challenges
remain. While the survey showed that Rust is making gains in the workplace,
the majority of respondents don&rsquo;t use use Rust at work, and many don&rsquo;t
expect to in the near future. The results also suggest that Rust users
struggle to reach productivity with the language, particularly in the first
year of use. You can check out the results for yourself on the Rust
Programming Language Blog.</li>

kubernetes-202-making-it-fully-operational-7416e4bb15ab) &ndash; &ldquo;A Kubernetes
cluster is a powerful tool. It gives you the power to deploy your
containerized workloads, automatically scale them, and schedule them across
multiple machines. It can even open up a load balancer for your service to
be exposed to the world (assuming you&rsquo;re running in a supported cloud).
Unfortunately, all of this functionality doesn&rsquo;t come out of the box.&rdquo;</li>

that Linux no longer really matters.â€¦The tech industry has a new operating
system it values: it&rsquo;s called Kubernetes.&rdquo; InfoWorld&rsquo;s Matt Asay explains why
Kubernetes has replaced Linux as the center of attention. It&rsquo;s not that Linux

recently noted, that&rsquo;s exactly the eventual future he hopes for Kubernetes.</li>
