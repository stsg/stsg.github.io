<p><a href="https://www.arp242.net/go-easy.html">Go may be simple. But it’s not easy.</a> &ndash;
The syntax is simple. Most of the semantics are simple. But getting something
done can sometimes be deceptively hard. Martin Tournoij takes a look at the
not-so-easy parts of Go (and what you can do about them).

<p><a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/the-3-mindsets-to-avoid-as-a-senior-software-developer-efc8fa17fc3">3 mindsets to avoid as a senior software
developer</a>
&ndash; I’m a self-taught programmer, and I need no one. I’m better than younger
programmers. New tech is just recycled old tech.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/giving-open-source-projects-life-after-a-developers-death">How to deal with the bus
factor</a>
&ndash; Developers have come up with a slightly morbid phrase to describe an open
source project’s vulnerability to becoming orphaned—“the bus factor.” It
refers to the number of people who would have to be hit by a bus before
there’s no one left to maintain the project. Libraries.io has identified about
3,000 open source libraries that are used in many other programs but have only
a handful of contributors. Some open source software modules rely on just
a single developer. What happens when they die?</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/coderibbon.html">Navigate your code like it&rsquo;s 2021</a>
&ndash; Empirical studies found that developers spend 35-50% of their time just
navigating code. Many of these navigations are wasted though, given that 50%
of them yielded less information than developers expected and 40% required
more effort than predicted.</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/844224/">An introduction to lockless algorithms</a> &ndash;
Lockless algorithms are of interest for the Linux kernel when traditional
locking primitives either cannot be used or are not performant enough.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-algorithm-breaks-speed-limit-for-solving-linear-equations-20210308">New Algorithm Breaks Speed Limit for Solving Linear
Equations</a>
&ndash; By harnessing randomness, a new algorithm achieves a fundamentally novel
— and faster — way of performing one of the most basic computations in math
and computer science.</p>

<p><a href="https://kirby.kevinson.org/blog/iso-8601-the-better-date-format">ISO 8601: the better date format</a>

it comes to international communication (such as posting things online), and
as you can see, I have enough reasons to say so.</p>

<p><a href="https://adam.nels.onl/blog/an-oo-languge-for-the-20s/">An Object-Oriented Language for the
&rsquo;20s</a> &ndash;
Object-oriented programming is out of fashion now, and it has been for
a while. Rarely are new programming languages intentionally object-oriented.
And there are good reasons for this: OO often requires a lot of boilerplate,
it forces code into unnatural object hierarchies, and it encourages hidden
mutable state.</p>

<p><a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124">The SPACE of Developer Productivity</a>
&ndash; Developer productivity is complex and nuanced, with important implications
for software development teams. A clear understanding of defining, measuring,
and predicting developer productivity could provide organizations, managers,
and developers with the ability to make higher-quality software—and make it
more efficiently.</p>

organizations are embracing GraphQL as a way to unify their enterprise-wide data

with its network of related entities. Such efforts are laudable but often entail

followed by the development and integration of all relevant entities into
a single monolithic graph.</p>
