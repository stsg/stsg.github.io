<p><a href="https://ciechanow.ski/gps/">GPS</a> &ndash; Global Positioning System is, without a
doubt, one of the most useful inventions of the late 20th century. It made it
significantly easier for ships, airplanes, cars, and hikers to figure out
where they are with high degree of accuracy.</p>

<p><a href="https://eng.uber.com/how-we-saved-70k-cores-across-30-mission-critical-services/">How we saved 70K cores across 30 mission-critical
services</a>
&ndash; As part of Uber engineering’s wide efforts to reach profitability, recently
our team was focused on reducing cost of compute capacity by improving
efficiency. Some of the most impactful work was around GOGC optimization. In
this blog we want to share our experience with a highly effective, low-risk,
large-scale, semi-automated Go GC tuning mechanism.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev.to/kathryngrayson/figma-for-developers-6op">Figma for developers</a>
&ndash; If you&rsquo;re a developer who works with designers, you&rsquo;re already familiar
with the infamous &ldquo;handoff&rdquo; – that point in the workflow when you start
turning wireframes and mockups into code. Even if you&rsquo;re not personally
familiar with the process, it&rsquo;s probably unsurprising to hear that this can be
a real pain point. This pain can be lessened, however, when both sides have an
understanding of what the other will be looking for in the handoff process.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/why-is-my-rust-build-so-slow">Why is my Rust build so slow?</a>
&ndash; “If you haven’t been writing Rust for a long time, you’ve probably heard
‘Rust compile times are long’ and so it might be hard for you to gauge whether
over one minute is excessive for a hot build. Luckily I’m here to tell you: of
course it’s excessive. Anything over a few seconds is excessive. So, how do we
find what’s going on?”</p>

<p><a href="https://abdullin.com/beautiful-tech-debt/">Beautiful technical debt</a> &ndash; What
looks like a technical debt in a software solution, might be the most

is a beauty in that, if observed from a distance.</p>

coding</a>
&ndash; As engineers, we divide our work between designing solutions and building
them. In this post, I&rsquo;ll focus on deciding how much time and effort should go
into design work that happens before any execution (coding).</p>

<p>“The <a href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/whois.html">WHOIS</a> protocol is one of
the older internet protocols around. It&rsquo;s infuriatingly simple, by and large
considered obsolete, and the data provided by it is unpredictable,
unreliable, incomplete, and, of course, still one of the cornerstones of
internet operations.”</p>

<p><a href="https://dev.to/blag/5-old-programming-languages-you-should-know-about-3ofe">5 old Programming Languages you should know
about</a>
&ndash; An old programming language can teach you a lot and can make you for sure
a better developer. People today are getting used to have everything provided
by the language and that&rsquo;s bad because it doesn&rsquo;t force you to think. Old
programming language lack a lot of things that you find in modern languages,
but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not as powerful, as they provide you all the
tools to implement things yourself.</p>

The year is 2022 and 35 years later, I still remember that damned sentence.

<li>
<p><a href="https://tiemoko.com/blog/vintage-tech-books/">Technical time travel: On vintage programming
books</a> &ndash; What if we turn that
lens backward, toward the yesteryear innovations of our shared past? Not in an
effort to gain some competitive edge in the present - although the insight of
historical context can be piercing - but simply to satisfy intellectual
curiosity. To scratch that innocent itch for understanding how things work.
Or, given hindsight, why they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
