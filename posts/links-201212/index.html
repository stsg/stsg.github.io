<p><a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/ex-googler-guide-dev-tools/">An ex-Googler&rsquo;s guide to dev
tools</a> &ndash; Many
years ago, I did a brief stint at Google. A lot has changed since then, but
even that brief exposure to Google&rsquo;s internal developer tools left a lasting
impression on me. In many ways, the dev tools inside Google are the most
advanced in the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://stephendiehl.com/posts/exotic03.html">Exotic Programming Ideas: Effect
Systems</a> &ndash; Continuing on in our
series on exotic programming ideas, we’re going to explore the topic of
effects. Weak forms of effect tagging are found in many mainstream programming
languages, however the use of programming with whole effect systems that
define syntax for defining and marking regions of effects in the surface
syntax is still an open area in language design.</p>

<p><a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">Readme Driven
Development</a>
&ndash; A perfect implementation of the wrong specification is worthless. By the
same principle a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also
damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can
figure out how to use it, there’s something very bad going on.</p>

<p><a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/pijul-version-control-system">Pijul - The Mathematically Sound Version Control System Written in
Rust</a> &ndash; Pijul is
an up-and-coming version control system (VCS) that combines aspects of
third-generation VCS tools such as Git and Darcs. It is written in Rust and
the first alpha version was released in November 2020. Pijul strives to be
mathematically sound and more natural in its understanding and implementation
of version tracking than existing systems while ensuring optimal performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://initialcommit.com/blog/pijul-creator">Q&amp;A with the Creator of the Pijul Version Control
System</a> &ndash; This article is a Q&amp;A
with Pierre-Étienne Meunier, the creator and lead developer of the Pijul VCS
(version control system). We asked him a series of questions related to his
background, the creation of Pijul, and the overall direction of the version
control field. His answers were extremely interesting and worth a read.</p>

explained</a>
&ndash; The way we write, ship, and maintain software today has evolved drastically
in the last few years. How we consume underlying infrastructure to run our
software has matured significantly, in that we have seen a transition from
bare metal to virtual machines to containers to micro-VMs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/cobol-controls-your-money">The Code That Controls Your
Money</a>
&ndash; COBOL is a coding language older than Weird Al Yankovic. The people who
know how to use it are often just as old. It underpins the entire financial
system. And it can’t be removed. How a computer language controls the
financial life of the world.

<p>Every year on September 19, Dr. Scott Fahlman passes out smiley face cookies.
That’s because, in 1987, he invented the smiley face emoticon to help people
recognize sarcasm (and thus curtail flame wars) on a Carnegie Mellon
University bulletin board. “Sometimes I know how Dr. Frankenstein felt,” he
says. “It’s not like I’m famous for having [driven] into a school bus full of
children or something. [The smiley is] not a bad thing to be famous for. Not
what I would’ve chosen, but so be it. But after a forty-year career working on
AI &ndash; <a href="https://narratively.com/the-father-of-the-emoticon-chases-his-great-white-whale/">I could solve AI and I know what the first line of my obit would
be</a>”.</p>
