<p><a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/cs/resources/beauty-of-programming">The beauty of
programming</a> &ndash;
I don’t know how to really explain my fascination with programming, but I’ll
try. To somebody who does it, it’s the most interesting thing in the world.
It’s a game much more involved than chess, a game where you can make up your
own rules and where the end result is whatever you can make of it. And yet, to
the outside, it looks like the most boring thing on Earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2021/04/22/some-useful-regular-expressions-for-programmers/">Some useful regular expressions for
programmers</a>
&ndash; Regular expressions can look intimidating and outright ugly. However, they
should not be underestimated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/switch-case-statements-are-coming-to-python-d0caf7b2bfd3">Switch/case statements are coming to
Python</a>
&ndash; Structural pattern matching (a.k.a. switch/case statements) has been
missing from Python until this latest release (3.10). Here’s a look at how
this new logic works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://martinheinz.dev/blog/46">All The Important Features and Changes in Python 3.10</a>
&ndash; Population counts, type checking improvements, context manager syntax
improvements, performance improvements. Here’s a list.</p>

<p><a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/11-refactoring-patterns-to-elevate-your-python-code-a47dbe5826d">11 refactoring patterns to elevate your Python
code</a>
&ndash; Refactoring could include new functionalities—if we’re willing to expand
the definition of refactoring just a little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://c9x.me/compile/bib/?">The compiler writer resource page</a> &ndash; I know
complete pans of the literature are left out, but this is a page for amateur
compiler writers. Anything that I did not find practical is not listed here.
(I also did not include the things that I do not yet know!) All the remarks in
grey and even the selection of documents are personal. If you have suggestions
of papers to include, please contact me! Finally, the order of items in the
various sections is totally arbitrary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.kchung.co/faster-python-with-go-shared-objects/">Faster Python with Go shared objects (the easy
way)</a>
&ndash; Okay, Python can be slow. But it has the ability to import code from shared
objects. Many libraries leverage this to make certain parts of Python code go
faster. Kevin Chung uses this strategy to speed up the HTML processing on one
of his projects. In this post, he walks through using Go to generate the
shared object.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://thenewstack.io/using-web-assembly-written-in-rust-on-the-server-side/">Using WebAssembly written in Rust on the
server-side</a>
&ndash; “The real benefit of WebAssembly is using the technology to do
computationally intensive work from within a browser.” This tutorial shows how
to program a WebAssembly binary in Rust and use it in a TypeScript-powered web
server running under Deno.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/jon-corbett">An interview with the developer of Cree# and Ancestral
Code</a> &ndash; Jon Corbett’s languages
Cree# and Ancestral Code allow programming in Cree keywords using Cree
concepts and metaphors. He’s also at work on the Indigenous Coding Framework,
which will help other indigenous communities bring their languages, and their
cultural logic and values to computing. In this interview, Corbett discusses
some of the challenges of his work—such as accidentally including colonial
understandings in such a system and working with technologies that assume
programming languages have Roman-character keywords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://felleisen.org/matthias/7480-s21/index.html">History of programming languages</a>
&ndash; The primary goal is to understand some of the major themes in the
discipline as it exists today and how these themes evolved in several steps.
Initially, the seminar will focus on two themes close to the instructor’s
heart: how semantics emerged and how languages evolved that do not adhere to
the common idea of a fixed syntax, scope, and semantics. The choice of other
themes will entirely depend on students’ interests and preferences. All
programming language themes are welcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.vnaik.com/posts/web-attacks.html">CSRF, CORS, and HTTP security headers demystified</a>
&ndash; With an increasing number of breaches, intrusions, and data thefts,
securing a web application is extremely important. On the other hand,
programmers often do not have a strong grasp of how attacks work and how to
mitigate them. This post attempts to close that gap a little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/why-programmers-dont-write-documentation/">Why programmers don’t write
documentation</a>
&ndash; I believe that there are two main reasons software engineers don’t write
documentation. Tools play their part but they are a hugely distant third.</p>

<p><a href="https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/">Git from the bottom up</a>
&ndash; Welcome to the world of Git. I hope this document will help to advance your
understanding of this powerful content tracking system, and reveal a bit of
the simplicity underlying it — however dizzying its array of options may seem
from the outside.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/learn-how-things-work/">Get better at programming by learning how things
work</a> &ndash; It sounds obvious. Well,
it is obvious. But learning how the systems you use work will make you
a better programmer. Julia Evans gives some examples here.</p>

but very interesting. Zellij is on the surface just another terminal
multiplexer. But it’s webassembly plugin system and plans for a browser based
interface look interfacing for sharing reusable UIs.</p>

interviews</a>
&ndash; It’s no secret that the technical interview process leaves something to be

take a look at seven of the most common mistakes candidates make in their
technical interviews and explore ways you can avoid them.</p>

<p><a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2021/03/11/castlequest-update/">The “Lost game” Castlequest (1980) has been
found.</a> &ndash;
Arthur O’Dwyer talked the game’s developers, Mike Holtzman and Mark
Kershenblatt, into retrieving the game from the US Copyright Office. To their
surprise, it wasn’t just a transcript—it was the full Fortran source code and
data files for the entire game, all 78 pages, printed out. The story of the
game’s resurrection is here, and the compilable code is
<a href="https://github.com/Quuxplusone/Castlequest">available here</a>.</p>

Overflow?</a>

someone typed Command+C, we realized there was also an opportunity to learn
about how people use our site. Here’s what we found.</p>
