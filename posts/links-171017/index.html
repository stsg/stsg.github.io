<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/10/severe-flaw-in-wpa2-protocol-leaves-wi-fi-traffic-open-to-eavesdropping">Krack Attack</a> &ndash; force WPA2 to reuse a key, making your secure network roll over

<p>How Apple <a href="https://betanews.com/2017/10/13/apple-killed-ios-jailbreaking">Killed</a>
iOS Jailbreaking &ndash; First, they force their opponent to find four vulnerabilities;
fixing any one of which breaks the jailbreak and forces the attacker to find a
new flaw that serves the same purpose. Second, and perhaps more critically,
Apple ensures that at least one of those flaws must be in the boot sequence.
This is a huge advantage because, unlike most programs, boot loaders are
typically relatively small (hundreds or thousands of lines of code, not
millions) and they don’t need a lot of new features added over time. Thus,
attackers can’t count on the bootloaders introducing new flaws. This creates a
&ldquo;narrow pass,&rdquo; and, as Sun Tzu advised (&ldquo;With regard to narrow passes, if you
can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of
the enemy.&rdquo;), Apple has fortified it</p>
