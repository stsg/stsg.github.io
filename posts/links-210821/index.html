<p><a href="https://research.swtch.com/plmm">Programming language memory models</a> &ndash;
“Programming language memory models answer the question of what behaviors
parallel programs can rely on to share memory between their threads.” Here’s
a look at formalizing programming language memory models from Go language team
lead Russ Cox.</p>

<p><a href="https://avi.im/blag/2021/fast-sqlite-inserts/">Towards inserting one billion rows in SQLite under a
minute</a> &ndash; Recently, I ran into
a situation where I needed a test database with lots of rows and needed it
fast. So I did what any programmer would do: wrote a Python script to generate
the DB. Unfortunately, it was slow. Really slow. So I did what any programmer
would do: went down the rabbit hole of learning more about SQLite, Python, and
eventually Rust… in my quest to get a 1B row database under a minute. This
blog post is a summary of this fun and educational exercise.</p>

explore ways to automatically visualize a GitHub repo, and how that could be
useful.</p>

<p><a href="https://renato.athaydes.com/posts/how-to-write-slow-rust-code.html">How to write really slow Rust
code</a> &ndash;
Renato Athaydes ported Peter Norvig’s Lisp solution to Lutz Prechelt’s phone
encoding problem to Java, Rust, Julia, and Dart. Rust was sloooow—showing the
lowest memory usage and the highest LOC (lines of code). Here’s how Renato
fixed that.</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/05/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/">Best practices for writing code
comments</a>
&ndash; While there are many resources to help programmers write better code—such
as books and static analyzers—there are few for writing better comments. While
it&rsquo;s easy to measure the quantity of comments in a program, it&rsquo;s hard to
measure the quality, and the two are not necessarily correlated. A bad comment
is worse than no comment at all. Here are some rules to help you achieve
a happy medium.</p>

<p><a href="https://0ver.org/">Zero based versioning</a> &ndash; With software releases at an

code</a>
&ndash; Quality is the responsibility of the culture of the team and the senior
members of the development team. The customer and non-technical people won’t
understand or value the quality steps in development, but you have to insist
on it.</p>

<p><a href="https://trstringer.com/20-questions-for-new-software-team/">20 questions a software engineer should ask when joining a new
team</a> &ndash; Different
software development teams do things quite differently. Even within a single
company, many of the variables can vary from team to team. As a software
engineer, it is usually very exciting to start working with new people and on
new software. On a personal note, I recently have started with a new team and
on new (to me) software. Because this isn’t a regular or frequent occurrence,
I took the opportunity to really think about things that I needed to learn in
the short term.</p>

its final form. Earlier iterations were already available as an experimental
feature, but you can expect the availability and use of HTTP/3 proper to ramp
up over in 2021. So what exactly is HTTP/3? Why was it needed so soon after
HTTP/2? How can or should you use it? And especially, how does it improve web
performance? Let’s find out.</p>

built</a>
&ndash; Dwarf Fortress is one of those oddball passion projects that’s broken into
Internet consciousness. It’s a free game where you play either an adventurer
or a fortress full of dwarves in a randomly generated fantasy world. The
simulation runs deep, with new games creating multiple civilizations with
histories, mythologies, and artifacts. I reached out to him to see how he’s
managed a single, growing codebase over 15+ years, the perils of pathing, and
debugging dead cats. Our conversation below has been edited for clarity.</p>
