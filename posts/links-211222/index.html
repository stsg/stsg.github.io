<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/prabhatsharma/zinc">Zinc</a> &ndash; Zinc is a search engine that
does full text indexing. It is a lightweight alternative to Elasticsearch and
runs in less than 100 MB of RAM. It uses bluge as the underlying indexing
library.</li>

<p><a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/computer-networking-101/">Computer networking basics every developer should
know</a> &ndash; As a software
engineer, I need to deal with networking every now and then - be it
configuring a SOHO network, setting up container networking, or
troubleshooting connectivity between servers in a data center. The domain is
pretty broad, and the terminology can get quite confusing quickly. This
article is my layman&rsquo;s attempt to sort the basic things out with the minimum
words and maximum drawings. The primary focus will be on the Data link layer
(OSI L2) of wired networks where the Ethernet is the king nowadays. But I&rsquo;ll
slightly touch upon its neighboring layers too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ervinbarta.com/2021/10/19/slo-alerting-for-mortals/">SLO alerting for mortals</a>
&ndash; This post shows the math of creating an alert for a service level objective
(SLO), step-by-step (and with animations), including how to avoid alerting for
the entire sliding window even after the problem is fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://buoyant.io/service-mesh-manifesto/">What every software engineer needs to know about the world’s most overhyped
technology</a> &ndash; The service
mesh—some people love it. Some people hate it. Most don’t understand it.
William Morgan belongs to the second group. In this post he explains what the
service mesh is and why he thinks it’s overhyped.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.cruform.com/sre-capability-map/">SRE Capability Map</a> &ndash; This map
shows all capabilities that fit the SRE domain. Use it to build and guide your
org’s SRE function.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/five-network-commands">5 Linux Network Troubleshooting Commands</a>
&ndash; Linux provides many command-line tools to help sysadmins manage, configure,
and troubleshoot network settings. This article covers five network
configuration and troubleshooting tools for Linux.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/container-learning-path/">Learning containers from the bottom up</a>
&ndash; When I started using containers back in 2015, my initial understanding was
that they were just lightweight virtual machines with a subsecond startup
time. With such a rough idea in my head, it was easy to follow tutorials from
the Internet on how to put a Python or a Node.js application into a container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve">Soft Serve</a> &ndash; A tasty,
self-hostable Git server for the command line.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mtlynch/logpaste">Logpaste</a> is a simple service you can
run for those times when you want to easily share log file snippets or other
text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/04/how-to-use-dig/">How to use dig</a> &ndash; When I
first started using dig I found it a bit intimidating – there are so many
options! I’m going to leave out most of dig’s options in this post and just
talk about the ones I actually use.</p>

<p><a href="https://danluu.com/why-benchmark/">Some reasons to measure</a> &ndash; A question
I get asked with some frequency is: why bother measuring X, why not build
something instead? More bluntly, in a recent conversation with a newsletter
author, his comment on some future measurement projects I wanted to do (in the
same vein as other projects like keyboard vs. mouse, keyboard, terminal and
end-to-end latency measurements) was, &ldquo;so you just want to get to the top of
Hacker News?&rdquo; The implication for the former is that measuring is less valuable
than building and for the latter that measuring isn&rsquo;t valuable at all (perhaps
other than for fame), but I don&rsquo;t see measuring as lesser let alone worthless.
If anything, because measurement is, like writing, not generally valued, it&rsquo;s
much easier to find high ROI measurement projects than high ROI building
projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mindtheproduct.com/overengineering-can-kill-your-product/">Overengineering can kill your
product</a>
&ndash; I believe it because we will talk about one of the most prevalent issues
when creating products: overengineering them. In my opinion, overengineering
has killed more products than the absence of good development practices.</p>
