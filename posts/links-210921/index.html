know</a>
&ndash; Recently, I’ve been reading through the excellent Database Internals (Alex
Petrov, 2019). The first half of the book is dedicated to the implementation
of database storage engines – the subsystem(s) of a DBMS that handles
long-term persistence of data. A surprising amount of this section discusses
the implementation and optimization of various B-Tree data structures.</p>

95% of their day writing.</p>

or on standalone projects. The silver lining is the encouragement of learning
and at some point this becomes knowledge, however, hands-on work can lead to
cuts in paths that later cause a series of problems in productive
environments. Therefore, the purpose of this guide is to help with the
learning curve, helping to prepare a more stable, reliable and functional
environment.</p>

below 350 ms or 2) 95% take 400 ms?” Read more here.</p>

<p><a href="https://baturin.org/blog/life-before-unicode/">Life before Unicode</a> &ndash;
Unicode definitely added a lot of complexity to string handling, and people
who use languages with ASCII alphabets exclusively may think it&rsquo;s unjustified.
However, I&rsquo;m a non-ASCII language speaker who&rsquo;s old enough to remember the
alternatives, and the alternatives are far worse than the complexity of
Unicode.</p>
