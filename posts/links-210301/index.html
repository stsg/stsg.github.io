<p><a href="https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/yestercode.html">Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes
ago?</a>
&ndash; A study found that Java developers backtracked every 6 minutes, meaning
they reverted their code to a previous state (e.g., by clicking undo or
pressing Ctrl-Z). These undo actions come in bursts and are often followed
by successive redo actions. In fact, one participant in a different study
used undo/redo 40 times in 5 minutes! When asked why they did this, they
revealed they were trying to view some intermediate state of the code in the
middle of a change.</p>

company</a>
&ndash; Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (FAANG) are some of the
largest tech companies in the world. They can be great to work at for many
reasons. If you’re an employee at any of the FAANG companies, you’ll most
likely earn a great salary and have access to a robust developer network to
learn from. If you don’t work at a FAANG company, you might feel a little
left out.</p>

<p><a href="https://tanelpoder.com/posts/reasons-why-select-star-is-bad-for-sql-performance/">Reasons why SELECT * is bad for SQL
performance</a>
&ndash; Here’s a list of reasons why SELECT * is bad for SQL performance,
assuming that your application doesn’t actually need all the columns. When
I write production code, I explicitly specify the columns of interest in the
select-list (projection), not only for performance reasons, but also for
application reliability reasons. For example, will your application’s data
processing code suddenly break when a new column has been added or the
column order has changed in a table?</p>

understand for anyone consuming them, future-proof, and secure and fast
since they serve data to clients that may be confidential.</p>

<p><a href="https://blainsmith.com/articles/plain-text-protocols/">Plain Text Protocols</a>
&ndash; If you haven&rsquo;t noticed already I really love plain text so I thought I
would find some plain text protocols that are used in different software
systems. The Redis Protocol specification states it best by describing its
own protocol, but this applies to all of the plain text protocols I will
cover.</p>
